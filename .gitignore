# Poetry
poetry.lock # Often committed, but can be ignored if all devs use `poetry install` from pyproject.toml
# If you choose to ignore poetry.lock, make sure your pyproject.toml has precise versions
# or use `poetry export` to generate a requirements.txt for production if needed.
# For ADK samples, it's common to commit poetry.lock to ensure consistent environments.
# So, you might want to REMOVE the line below if you want to track poetry.lock:

# Consider adding specific large model files if downloaded locally
